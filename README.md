This program simulates a basic banking system that allows users to perform money transfers between accounts. Each user is represented by a User struct containing a unique userID and a balance. The program first takes an integer input for the number of users and initializes each user's details. It then processes multiple transactions where money is transferred between users. If a transfer is valid (i.e., the sender has sufficient balance and both users exist), the transfer is executed, and "Success" is printed; otherwise, "Failure" is printed. After all transactions are processed, the users are sorted based on their balance in ascending order, and in case of ties, by userID in ascending order. Finally, the program outputs the updated list of users and their balances.
